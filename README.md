# Ecstra

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/DavidPeicho/ecstra.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/DavidPeicho/ecstra)


> üöß Ecstra is a work-in-progress and might be unstable, use it at your
> own risks üöß

Fast & Flexible EntityComponentSystem (ECS) for JavaScript and Typescript, available in browser and Node.js.

Get started with:
* The [Documentation](./DOC.md)
* The [Examples](./example)

> üîç I am currently looking for people to help me to identify their needs in order to drive the development of this [library further](#stable-version).

## Philosophy

Ecstra (pronounced as "eck-stra") is heavily based on [Ecsy](https://github.com/ecsyjs/ecsy), but mixes concepts from other great ECS. It also share some concepts with
[Hecs](https://github.com/gohyperr/hecs/).

My goals for the library is to keep it:

* üíª Framework Agnostic üíª
* ü™∂ Lightweight ü™∂
* ‚ö° Fast ‚ö°
* üèãÔ∏è Robust üèãÔ∏è

The library will prioritize stability improvements over feature development.

## Features

* Easy To Use Query Language
* System Grouping
* System Topological Sorting
* Automatic Component Registration
* Component Properties Merging
* System Queries Merging
* TypeScript Decorators
  * For component properties
  * For system ordering and configuration

## Install

Using npm:

```sh
npm install ecstra
```

Using yarn

```sh
yarn add ecstra
```

The library is distributed as an ES6 module, but also comes with two UMD builds:
* `fecs/umd/fecs.js` ‚Üí Development build with debug assertions
* `fecs/umd/fecs.min.js` ‚Üí Minified production build, without  debug assertions

## Usage Example

```js
import {
  ComponentData,
  TagComponent,
  NumberProp,
  RefProp,
  World
} from 'ecstra';

/**
 * Components definition.
 */

class Position2D extends ComponentData {}
Position2D.Properties = {
  x: NumberProp(),
  y: NumberProp()
};

class FollowTarget extends ComponentData {}
FollowTarget.Properties = {
  target: RefProp(),
  speed: NumberProp(1.0)
};

class PlayerTag extends TagComponent {}
class ZombieTag extends TagComponent {}

/**
 * Systems definition.
 */

class ZombieFollowSystem extends System {

  execute(delta) {
    this.queries.zombies.execute((entity) => {
      const { speed, target } = entity.read(FollowTarget);
      const position = entity.write(Position2D);
      const deltaX = target.x - position.x;
      const deltaY = target.y - position.y;
      const len = Math.sqrt(deltaX * deltaX + deltaY * deltaY);
      if (len >= 0.00001) {
        position.x += speed * delta * (deltaX / len);
        position.y += speed * delta * (deltaY / len);
      }
    });
  }

}
ZombieFollowSystem.Queries = {
  // Select entities with all three components `ZombieTag`, `FollowTarget`, and
  // `Position2D`.
  zombies: [ZombieTag, FollowTarget, Position2D]
}

const world = new World();

// Creates a player entity.
const playerEntity = world.create().add(PlayerTag).add(Position2D);
const playerPosition = playerEntity.read();

// Creates 100 zombies at random positions with a `FollowTarget` component that
// will make them follow our player.
for (let i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
  world.create()
    .add(ZombieTag)
    .add(Position2D, {
      x: Math.floor(Math.random() * 50.0) - 100.0,
      y: Math.floor(Math.random() * 50.0) - 100.0
    })
    .add(FollowTarget, { target: playerPosition })
}

// Runs the animation loop and execute all systems every frame.

let lastTime = 0.0;
function loop() {
  const currTime = performance.now();
  const deltaTime = currTime - lastTime;
  lastTime = currTime;
  world.execute(deltaTime);
  requestAnimationFrame(loop);
}
lastTime = performance.now();
loop();
```

## Stable Version

The library is brand new and it's the perfect time for me to taylor it to match as much as possible most of the developer needs.

I want to open discussion about the following topics:
* Deferred creation and removal of components
* Deferred creation and removal of entities
* Command buffers
* Query system improvement
  * New selector (`Modified`? `Removed`?)
* Is a `StateComponent` component needed?

Please feel free to reach out directly in the [Github Issues](https://github.com/DavidPeicho/ecstra/issues) or contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DavidPeicho) to discuss those topics.

## Benchmarks

Coming soon.
